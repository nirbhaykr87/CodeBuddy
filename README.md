## Overview

This project is a real-time collaborative code editor built using React, Node.js, and Socket.io. It supports C++, Java, and Python, providing a seamless experience for multiple users to collaborate on code in real-time. Features include synchronized editing, multi-language support, real-time chat, and in-app code execution. Users can create unique rooms using UUIDs, enabling easy access via referral links for enhanced collaboration.

## Features

- **🚀 Real-Time Collaboration**: Multiple users can edit code simultaneously with changes synchronized in real-time.
- **🌐 Multi-Language Support**: Supports coding in C++, Java, and Python.
- **💬 Real-Time Chat**: In-app chat feature allows users to communicate while coding.
- **⚙️ In-App Code Execution**: Execute C++, Java, and Python code within the app (requires respective setups on the system).
- **🔗 Unique Room Creation**: Rooms created with UUIDs for easy sharing and access via referral links.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)
- C++ compiler
- Python (v3.6 or later)
- Java (JDK 8 or later)

Ensure you have the necessary environment setup for running C++, Python, and Java code on your system.
